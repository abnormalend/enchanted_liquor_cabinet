# Set up our neopixels.  The configuration for my cabinet has a ring of pixels where the old bulb was (top in config), 
#   plus strips running down the left, center, and middle of each cabinet (main in config).  Those strips run in parallel
#   so they each get the same signal.  Turning on the first pixel in side 1 main is going to give you the first pixel in those
#   three columns.  This is by no means the only way to do it, I just decided that the wiring would be simpler an couldn't 
#   envision a use case where I really needed those 3 columns to be different colors.

# our lights are all driven off a single pin, and goes from side 1 (right) to side 2 (left):  1-top, 1-main, 2-top, 2-main
