Links to what I bought on amazon, but most of these things have a bunch of different choices.

- [2 * 16 pixel WS2812B rings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078YKQKX3)
- [1 * 5M WS2812B 60 LED/M strip](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNRHH8Z)
- [4 * Magnetic Reed Switches](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JZ4C53V)
- [1 * DFPlayer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNRHH8Z)
- [2 * 3W 40mm Speakers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LN8ONG4)
- [1 * PAM8403 Amplifier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LODGV64)
- [1 * PCB Strip Board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZYTZ48N) I like how this one can have an ESP32 Dev board Straddle the middle of two sections.
- 1 * 5V Power supply.  This will depend on how many lights you have to drive, The one I am using is likely overkill but I already had it around.
- [1 * ESP32 Dev Board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q576VWZ)  Lots of variations available, I stick to the WROOM-32 
- Printed fittings, see STL folder in this repo.
