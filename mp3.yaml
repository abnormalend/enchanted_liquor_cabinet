#  The DFPlayer is a teensy, super simple MP3 player that uses a microSD card for reading the MP3's.  You can control it
#  via uart like we are doing here, or do simple triggers by attaching buttons to certain pins.  Docs at the link above.

#The numbers for what track to play in the scripts below are based on the order files are placed onto the microsd.
